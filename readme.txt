This is intended to work with Automatic-Article-Searcher-V2 (Or atleast it's results folder).

This script should get (not 'gets' because it is still work in progress) the links, gathered by previously mentioned script, as input and return cleaned up (removed stopwords, whitespace, symbols, numbers, punctuation, trimmed words and anything else that I will come up with in the future) article text and store it in basic text files in Python's dictionary format.

The results are raw text with no styling, spacing etc. (yet). 

To change the:
 * directory/input file format, modify link_gen function.
